Is it true that this is an atom?
    atom

Yes, because it is a string.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is an atom?
    turkey

Yes, because it is a string.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is true that this is an atom?
    1492

Yes, because it is a string of digits.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is true that this is an atom?
    u

Yes, it is a string of one letter.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is true that this is an atom?
    *abc$

Yes, because *abc$ is a string, that begins with a special character but isn't
a left or right parens.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is an atom?
    (atom)

Yes, because it is an atom enclosed by parens.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is a list?
    (atom turkey or)

Yes, because it is several atoms enclosed by parens.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is a list
    (atom turkey) or

No, because it is a list followed by an atom. More specifically, two
S-expressions not enclosed by parens.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is list?
    ((atom turkey) or)

Yes, because both S-expressions are enclosed by parens.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is true that this is an S-expression?
    xyz

Yes, because atoms are S-expressions.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is true that this is an S-expression?
    (x y z)

Yes, because it is a list.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is true that this is an S-expression.
    ((x y) z)

Yes, because it is a list containing a list (of two atoms) and an atom.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is a list?
    (how are you doing so far)

Yes, because it is a list of atoms enclosed by parens and all are atoms are
S-expressions.
________________________________________________________________________________

How many S-expressions are in the list
    (how are you doing so far)
and what are they?

Six: how, are, you, doing, so, far.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is a list?
    (((how) are) ((you) (doing so)) far)

Yes, because unraveling all parens reveals that it is atoms enclosed by parens
that properly match.
________________________________________________________________________________

How many S-expressions are in the list
    (((how) are) ((you) (doing so)) far)
and what are they?

Three: ((how) are), ((you) (doing so)) far
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is a list?
    ()

Yes, it is the empty list.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is an atom?
    ()

No, because () is just a list.
________________________________________________________________________________

Is it true that this is a list?
    (() () () ())

Yes, because it is several S-expressions enclosed by parens.
________________________________________________________________________________

What is the car of l where
    ((a b c) x y z)

(a b c).
________________________________________________________________________________

What is the car of l where l is
    hotdog

None. car can't be applied to an atom.
________________________________________________________________________________

What is the car of l where l is
    ()

None. car can't be applied to an empty list.

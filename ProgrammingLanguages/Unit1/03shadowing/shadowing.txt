Two reasons (either one sufficient)

val a = 1
val b = a (* b is bound to 1 *)
val a = 2

Expressions in variable bindings are evaluated eagerly
- Before the variable binding "finishes"
- Afterwards, the expression producing the value is irrelevant

There is no way to assing to a variable in ML
- Can only shadow it in a later environment

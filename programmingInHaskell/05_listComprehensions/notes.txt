Figure out why during lazy evaluation

prime n = factors n == [1,n]

doesn't have to produce all factors. It will return False as soon as some
other factor is produced (prime 15 will stop when [1,3] happens). I thought
that with lazy evaluation you apply the function and then evaluate left
to right???

1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).

double (double 2)   [apply inner double]
double (2 + 2)      [apply outer double]
(2 + 2) + (2 + 2)   [apply +]
8

2. Show that sum [x] = x for any number x.

sum[x] [apply sum]
x + sum [] [sum[] == 0]
x + 0 [identity]
x

3. Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers, and
show using your definition that product [2,3,4] = 24.

product [] = 0
product (x:xs) = x * product xs

4. How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it
produces a reverse sorted version of a list?

5. What would be the effect of replacing < = by < in the original definition of
qsort? Hint: consider the example qsort [2,2,3,1,1].

Public keys can be either compressed or uncompressed.

The public key is an x and y coordinate prefixed with a number, usually 04.
02 and 03 are used for compressed public keys.

Since it is possible to obtain the y coordinate if the x coordinate is given,
only the latter need be kept. To obtain y solve
    y^2 mod p = x^3 + 7 mod p

This reduces the size of every transaction by nearly half.

Notice that it would be impossible to determine if y were positive or negative
just by solving the equation. So then, the sign of the number needs to be
preserved: 02 if y is positive and 03 it is negative.

Compressed public keys will yield different addresses than uncompressed ones.
So wallet apps need to know if the private key was used to create compressed or
uncompressed. WIFs, which are used to represent private keys, now signify which
type the private keys were used to create.

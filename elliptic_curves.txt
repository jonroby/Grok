An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to an equation of the form
    y^2 = x^3 + ax = b
which is called a Weierstrauss equation.

The particular equation that Bitcoin uses (provided by sekp256k1) is
    y^2 = (x^3 + 7)
over a finite field of prime order p where
    p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1

What is p?

This equation will not look like a curve, but rather, random points scattered
symmetrically across the x-axis.

To add two points p1 and p2 on an elliptic curve, draw the line between p1 and
p2 and then find the point p3, where the line intersects with the curve. This is
guaranteed to exist. Then reflect that point about the x-axis. So if p3 = (x,y)
then its reflection p3' is (x,-y).

There are two special cases that need to be considered. First, when adding a
point to itself and second, when two points form a vertical line (have the same
x coordinate.)

To add a point to itself, take the tangent of p (by differentiation) and find
where that line crosses and proceed as before.

Adding two points that form a vertical line results in a point o, infinity. And
if you add a point to o, the result is just the point. So with elliptic curves,
infinity plays the role of 0 in traditional addition.

Multiplication for elliptic curves:
    x * y = y + y + y (x times)

The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is the problem of finding
x when given Z and y:
    Z = y + y + y (x times)

So x = log(y)(Z)

Finding Z is computationally easy, but finding x is computationally difficult;
a "trap door function".

val a_pair = (4,6);

val another_pair = {2=5, 1=6};
This will evalute: (6,5) : int * int

There are no such things as tuples in ML.

- Tuple syntax is just a different way to write certain records.
- (e1,...,en) is another way of writing {1:t1,...,n:tn}
- t1 * .. * tn is another way of writing {1:t1, ..., n:tn}

This is how ML defines tuples.
- Other than special syntax in programs and printing, they don't
exist.

Tuples are syntactic sugar for records with fields named 1,2,...n.
Syntactic: Can describe the semantics entirely be the corresponding
record syntax.
Sugar: They make the language sweeter.

They simplify understanding of language.
They simplify implementing the language.
Because they're are fewer semantics to worry about.

Another example we saw: andalso and orelse vs if then else.

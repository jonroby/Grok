val x = {bar=(1+2, true andalso true), foo=3+4, baz=(false,9)}

Records have a different type than anything we've seen:
{bar: int * bool, baz: bool * int, foo: int}
Type inference can figure this out.

Tuples are a little shorter, but records a little easier to remember.
The more items, choose a record (because it has naming).

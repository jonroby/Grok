Type synonyms

A type synonym is a new kind of binding
  type aname = t

They are interchangeable in every way.

So could use
  type card = suit * rank

type name_record = { student_num : int option
     		     first	 : string,
		     middle      : string option,
		     last	 : string }

fun is_Queen_of_Spaces (c : card) =
  #1 c = Spade andalso #2 c = Queen

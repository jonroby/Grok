If p is a variable x, the match succeeds and x is bound to v
If p is _, the match succeeds and no bindings are introduced.
If p is (p1...pn), and v is (v1...vn), the match succeeds iff
  p1 matches v1 ... pn matches vn. The bindings are the union
  of all bindings from the submatches
If p is C p1, the match succeeds if v is C v1 and p1 matches
  v1. The bindings are the bindings from the submatch.
... There are others.

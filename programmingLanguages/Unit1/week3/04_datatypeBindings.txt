datatype mytype = TwoInts of int * int
  	 	| Str of string
		| Pizza

Adds a new type mytype to the environment.
Adds constructors to the environment: TwoInts, Str, and Pizza.
A constructor is (among other things) a function that makes
values of the new type (or is a value of the new type).

- TwoInts : int * int -> mytype
- Str : string -> mytype
- Pizza: mytype

We need to access these.
Notice how our other one-of types used functions for this:
- null and isSome check variants
- hd, tl, and valOf extract data (raise exception on wrong variant)

ML could have done the same for datatype bindings
- For example, functions like isStr and getStrData
- Instead it did something much better

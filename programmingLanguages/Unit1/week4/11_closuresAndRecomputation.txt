Things we know:
- A function body is not evaluated until the function is called
- A function body is evaluated every time the function is called
- A variable binding evaluates its expression when the binding
  is evaluated not every time the variable is used.

With closures this means we can avoid repeating computations
that do not depend on function arguments
- Not so worried about performance, but good example to
  emphasize the semantics of functions

anonymous declaration fn x => x
fun triple_n_times (n,x) =
    n_times(fn x => 3*x,n,x)

With anonymous functions you can't use recursion. This is because
you aren't allowed to give them names (they are after all anonymous),
and so there is no way to recursively call the function.

val triple = fn y => 3 * y

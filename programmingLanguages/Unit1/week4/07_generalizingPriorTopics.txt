fun double_or_trip f =
  if f 7
  then fn x => 2 * x
  else fn x => 3 * x

t1 -> t2 -> t3 -> t4 (Arrows are right associative)

Higher order functions are not just for numbers and lists

They work great for common recursive traversals over your own
data structures (datatype bindings) too

Example of a higherorder predicate:

Are all constants in an arithemtic expression even numbers.

Use a more general function fn type

And call i with fn x = x mod 2 = 0

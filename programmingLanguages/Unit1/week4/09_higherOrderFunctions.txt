The function body is evaluted in the environment where the
function was defined (Created)
- Extended with the function argument

Nothing changes to this rule when we take and return functions
- But the environment may involve nested let-expressions,
  not just the top level sequence of bindings

Makes first-class functions much more powerful
- Even if may seem counterintuitive at first.

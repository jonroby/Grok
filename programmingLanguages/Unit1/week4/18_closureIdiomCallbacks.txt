Callbacks

A common idiom: library takes function to apply later, when an
event occurs -- examples:
  - When a key is pressed, mouse moves, data arrives
  - When the program enters some state (turns in a game)

A library may accept multiple callbacks
- Different callbacks may need different private data with
  different types.
- Fortunately, a function's type does not include the types of
  bindings in the environment
- In OOP objects and private fields are used similarly, e.g.,
  Java Swing's event listeners.

To generate a bitcoin address, take the SHA256 of the public key and then pass
that to RIPEMD160:

address = RIPEMD160(SHA256(public_key))

Remember that a bitcoin address is not identical to a public key; they are
derived from a public key.

This address is then encoded as Base58Check.

Base58Check has 58 symbols and includes everything that Base64 does, except for
zero, capital 'O', lower 'l', capital 'I', '+' and '/'. This is to avoid
transcription errors.

To convert the address to Base58Check, first, determine the prefix. In this case,
since the conversion is a bitcoin address, the prefix is 0x00. If it were a
private key, it would be 0x80.

Then double SHA the address and append the first four bytes to the address:
prefix + address + checksum.

Finally, Base58 encode this.
